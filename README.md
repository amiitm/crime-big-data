Apaches Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is developing as a prevalent programming segment for cloud computing joined alongside incorporating parts, for example, Map Reduce. Hadoop, which is an open source usage of Google MapReduce, including a distributed file system, gives to the application developer the reflection of the map and the reduce.There are many outcomes with the Big Data Analytics.

## Map Reduce

We will use Map Reduce algorithm to bring out use information from the data.
